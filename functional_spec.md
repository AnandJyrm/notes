# Functional Specification

What are the Software Requirements? Should have sufficient desing to establish external interactions. Precise, use diagrams not code.

Describe the solution. Articulate dependencies on others.

## Sections

 - Scope (problem statement and what this project covers)
 - Summary of Sections (Consider the audience for each section)
 - Software Architecture:
    - Set the context for the project
    - Avoid internal design details
    - Diagram the deliverables and interactions
 - Software Functional Requirements:
    - List the requirements the project addresses as a checklist
    - List down the limitations and restrictions
 - Software Dependencies:
    - Ensure non trivial assumptions on other teams/software are stated
 - Client Design Considerations:
    - How should a client adopt this software
 - Memory and Performance Impact
 - Security Considerations
 - Software Interace:
    - No pseudocode, no internal function names
 - Packaging Considerations
 - UI
 - Testing Considerations

## Workflow

 - Understand the feature
 - Define the requirements
 - Design the manageability interface
 - Understand your dependencies
 - Define the functional structure
 - Define the software interface
 - Flesh out the details
